		<description>Derived from popular highmates with a greater focus on physical aspects of lovin’, lowmates are attractive companions for those looking for no-risk thrills without the risk of pregnancy. They also lack any violence inhibitors, both to defend themselves against people who won’t take “no” as an answer and for the client with more eclectic tastes.\n\nDeveloped for the lower classes of urbworlds, lowmate xenogerms are tied with employment contracts for those willing to sell their bodies regularly. Numerous controversies surround its development, as the workers become physically dependent on their work and are almost always on the hunt for their next “meal”, however it’s also recognized that taking any legislative action would remove any protections they are legally guaranteed with their contracts. Lowmates typically are on the lookout for regulars, but some are actively deployed as social weapons in politics.</description>
