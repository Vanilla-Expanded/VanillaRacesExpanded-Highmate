	<description>Vanilla Races Expanded is a brand new series of mods to enhance Biotech features, add to the storytelling and the world-building of RimWorld, and to introduce new, cool types of xenohumans, complete with their own unique genes, behaviors, mechanics and items.

The goal of this mod is to greatly enhance the depth and complexity of the Highmate system in RimWorld, providing players with more engaging and diverse gameplay experiences.

Specifically, our aim is to:

Increase Customization: By adding more depth to the psychic bond system weâ€™re greatly enhancing the storytelling and allow players to use psychic bond to make their colonists even stronger.

Deepen Emotional Gameplay: The addition of lasting memories from lovemaking and the option to use psychic abilities for conception provides new emotional and psychological dimensions to the game. This encourages players to think more deeply about the relationships and emotional states of their colonists.

Enhance Strategic Decisions: The changes to existing mechanics and the introduction of new ones provide more strategic choices for players. The new genes make it important to decide who bonds with who, as the psychic bond greatly improves both bonded individuals.

Stay True to Lore: While introducing new gameplay elements, the mod aims to remain faithful to the lore and spirit of RimWorld. Highmates are still presented as empathic, non-violent, and highly attractive individuals, consistent with their original description. In addition to that, lowmates make an appearance - capable of violence nymphomaniacs that are bound to keep your colonists happy, but their rowdiness may lead to many break ups and romances!
